# non-functional-requirements.md — livespec-driver-codex

Contributor-facing invariants: how this repo is structured, guarded,
built, tested, and evolved. Where `contracts.md` says *what must be true*
of the Driver seam, this file says *how it is guarded* and how the repo
is operated.

## Boundary

This file covers the operational disciplines of developing the Driver
plugin: the task runner, the repo layout, the enforcement suite that
guards the contracts, the build/release flow, test discipline, and
spec-evolution rules. It does not restate the seam contracts themselves
(`contracts.md`) or the architectural constraints (`constraints.md`).

## Inherited from livespec

The family-standard operational disciplines apply here unmodified and are
owned upstream:

- **Primary-checkout commit-refuse hook** — every change uses a worktree
  → PR → merge → cleanup path; the primary checkout refuses direct
  commits/pushes. The hook body and its doctor fingerprint invariant are
  owned by `livespec/SPECIFICATION/non-functional-requirements.md`
  §"Primary-checkout commit-refuse hook" and `livespec/SPECIFICATION/contracts.md`
  §"`primary-checkout-commit-refuse-hook-installed`". This repo carries a
  copy of the canonical scaffold under `dev-tooling/`; it does not
  re-specify it.
- **Toolchain pinning** via `mise`; **`uv`** as the Python toolchain
  manager. Git operations that must fire lefthook are run through
  `mise exec -- git …`; `--no-verify` is never used.

## Task-runner discipline

`just` is the single source of truth for every dev-tooling invocation.
`lefthook` (pre-commit / pre-push) and CI delegate to `just <target>`;
neither invokes a tool binary directly. `just check` is the full
enforcement aggregate and is the load-bearing safety net — it runs
locally, in pre-push, and in CI.

## Repo layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` | The marketplace catalog (`livespec-driver-codex`), listing the single `livespec` plugin sourced from `./livespec` |
| `livespec/` | The Driver plugin: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, the eight `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` bindings, and the `hooks/` bundle (`hooks.json` + `livespec_footgun_guard.py`) |
| `dev-tooling/` | `check_plugin_structure.py` (the structural gate) plus the family-standard git-hook scaffold |
| `tests/e2e-cli/` | The CLI end-to-end harness consumer (mock-tier skill discovery + fail-closed fixture coverage gate + static binding assertions) |
| `tests/hooks/` | Unit tests for the plugin-shipped footgun guard |
| `SPECIFICATION/` | This spec tree (dogfooded) |
| `justfile`, `lefthook.yml`, `.mise.toml`, `.python-version`, `pyproject.toml` | Family-standard toolchain configuration |

## Enforcement suite

`just check` aggregates the gates that guard the `contracts.md` seam:

- **`check-plugin-structure`** — runs `dev-tooling/check_plugin_structure.py`
  (stdlib-only, fail-closed) to enforce the manifest, skill-set,
  binding-body, fenced-invocation, and hook-bundle contracts in
  `contracts.md`. This is the mechanical teeth behind §"Plugin manifest
  and marketplace", §"Skill-binding set", §"Core-root resolution",
  §"Fenced-invocation discipline", and §"Hook bundle".
- **`check-hooks`** — unit-tests the plugin-shipped footgun guard.
- **`check-e2e-cli`** — drives the CLI end-to-end harness (mock tier).
- **`check-codex-skill-picker`** — drives the live Codex TUI `/skills`
  picker on authenticated local Codex hosts. It opens `/skills`, chooses
  `List skills`, searches `orchestrate`, and fails unless the picker
  renders the `orchestrate (livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro)` Skill row.
  GitHub-hosted CI skips this gate unless an authenticated runner opts in
  with `LIVESPEC_REQUIRE_CODEX_TUI_PICKER=1`.
- **`check-heading-coverage`** — enforces that every `## ` H2 in this
  spec tree maps to an entry in `tests/heading-coverage.json`.
- **`check-lint`** / **`check-format`** — `ruff` lint and format gates.

Every gate is wired into both pre-commit/pre-push (via lefthook) and CI
(via the per-target matrix in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so the same
suite runs in every context.

## Build and release

The Driver ships as a Codex plugin. `plugin.json.version` is the single
source of truth for the shipped version and is auto-managed by
`release-please` from Conventional Commits (`contracts.md` §"Versioning").

## Test discipline

Two test surfaces back the enforcement suite: `tests/e2e-cli/` proves the
Driver bindings drive core's wrappers — the CI-safe mock tier runs real
structural skill discovery against the in-repo Codex plugin, real fixture
loading, the real fail-closed coverage gate, and static binding
assertions, with NO live `codex` subprocess (a live round-trip is gated
behind `LIVESPEC_E2E_HARNESS=real` since the `codex` CLI is not
guaranteed in CI). A separate live TUI picker acceptance in the same
directory covers the human `/skills` discovery path and is intentionally
host-aware: it runs where Codex is present and authenticated, but skips on
GitHub-hosted CI unless the runner explicitly opts in. `tests/hooks/`
unit-tests the footgun guard via subprocess invocation with a JSON stdin
payload, asserting on the emitted `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision`.

## Spec evolution

This `SPECIFICATION/` tree dogfoods livespec. Every change lands through
`livespec:propose-change` → `livespec:revise`, which snapshots the result
under `history/vNNN/`. `livespec:doctor`'s static phase flags
out-of-process drift, and `check-heading-coverage` mechanically enforces
that the spec's H2 set stays in lockstep with `tests/heading-coverage.json`.
